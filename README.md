## Getting Started: Quick Start

Get up and running in three simple steps:

1.  **Authenticate with AniList:**
    ```bash
    viu anilist auth
    ```
    This will open your browser. Authorize the app and paste the obtained token back into the terminal.

2.  **Launch the Interactive TUI:**
    ```bash
    viu anilist
    ```

3.  **Browse & Play:** Use your arrow keys to navigate the menus, select an anime, and choose an episode to stream instantly.

## Usage Guide

### The Interactive TUI (`viu anilist`)

This is the main, user-friendly way to use Viu. It provides a rich terminal experience where you can:
*   Browse trending, popular, and seasonal anime.
*   Manage your personal lists (Watching, Completed, Paused, etc.).
*   Search for any anime in the AniList database.
*   View detailed information, characters, recommendations, reviews, and airing schedules.
*   Stream or download episodes directly from the menus.

### Powerful Searching (`viu anilist search`)

Filter the entire AniList database with powerful command-line flags.

```bash
# Search for anime from 2024, sorted by popularity, that is releasing and not on your list
viu anilist search -y 2024 -s POPULARITY_DESC --status RELEASING --not-on-list

# Find the most popular movies with the "Fantasy" genre
viu anilist search -g Fantasy -f MOVIE -s POPULARITY_DESC

# Dump search results as JSON instead of launching the TUI
viu anilist search -t "Demon Slayer" --dump-json
```

### Background Downloads (`viu queue` & `worker`)

Viu includes a robust background downloading system.

1.  **Add episodes to the queue:**
    ```bash
    # Add episodes 1-12 of Jujutsu Kaisen to the download queue
    viu queue add -t "Jujutsu Kaisen" -r "0:12"
    ```
2.  **Start the worker process:**
    ```bash
    # Run the worker in the foreground (press Ctrl+C to stop)
    viu worker

    # Or run it as a background process
    viu worker &
    ```The worker will now process the queue, download your episodes, and check for notifications.

### Scriptable Commands (`download` & `search`)

These commands are designed for automation and quick, non-interactive tasks.

#### `download` Examples
```bash
# Download the latest 5 episodes of One Piece
viu download -t "One Piece" -r "-5"

# Download episodes 1 to 24, merge subtitles, and clean up original files
viu download -t "Jujutsu Kaisen" -r "0:24" --merge --clean
```

#### `search` (Binging) Examples
```bash
# Start binging an anime from the first episode
viu search -t "Attack on Titan" -r ":"

# Watch the latest episode directly
viu search -t "My Hero Academia" -r "-1"
```

### Local Data Management (`viu registry`)

Viu maintains a local database of your anime for offline access and enhanced performance.

*   `registry sync`: Synchronize your local data with your remote AniList account.
*   `registry stats`: Show detailed statistics about your viewing habits.
*   `registry backup`: Create a compressed backup of your entire registry.
*   `registry restore`: Restore your data from a backup file.
*   `registry export/import`: Export/import your data to JSON/CSV for use in other applications.
*   `registry clean`: Clean up orphaned or invalid entries from your local database.

## Configuration

Viu is highly customizable. A default configuration file with detailed comments is created on the first run.

*   **Find your config file:** `viu config --path`
*   **Edit in your default editor:** `viu config`
*   **Use the interactive wizard:** `viu config --interactive`

Most settings in the config file can be temporarily overridden with command-line flags (e.g., `viu --provider animepahe anilist`).

<details>
  <summary><b>Default Configuration (`config.ini`) Explained</b></summary>

```ini
# [general] Section: Controls overall application behavior.
[general]
provider = allanime          ; The default anime provider (allanime, animepahe).
selector = fzf               ; The interactive UI tool (fzf, rofi, default).

image_renderer = icat        ; Tool for terminal image previews (icat, chafa).
icons = True                 ; Display emoji icons in the UI.
auto_select_anime_result = True ; Automatically select the best search match.
...

# [stream] Section: Controls playback and streaming.
[stream]
player = mpv                 ; The media player to use (mpv, vlc).
quality = 1080               ; Preferred stream quality (1080, 720, 480, 360).
translation_type = sub       ; Preferred audio/subtitle type (sub, dub).
auto_next = False            ; Automatically play the next episode.

...

# [downloads] Section: Controls the downloader.
[downloads]

downloads_dir = ...          ; Directory to save downloaded anime.
max_concurrent_downloads = 3 ; Number of parallel downloads in the worker.

```
</details>

## Advanced Features

### MPV IPC Integration

When `use_ipc = True` is set in your config, Viu provides powerful in-player controls without needing to close MPV.

**Key Bindings:**
*   `Shift+N`: Play the next episode.
*   `Shift+P`: Play the previous episode.
*   `Shift+R`: Reload the current episode.
*   `Shift+A`: Toggle auto-play for the next episode.
*   `Shift+T`: Toggle between `dub` and `sub`.

**Script Messages (For MPV Console):**
*   `script-message select-episode <number>`: Jump to a specific episode.
*   `script-message select-server <name>`: Switch to a different streaming server.

### Running as a Service (Linux/systemd)

You can run the background worker as a systemd service for persistence.

1.  Create a service file at `~/.config/systemd/user/viu-worker.service`:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Viu Background Worker
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/path/to/your/viu worker --log
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=30

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```
    *Replace `/path/to/your/viu` with the output of `which viu`.*

2.  Enable and start the service:
    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable --now viu-worker.service
    ```
